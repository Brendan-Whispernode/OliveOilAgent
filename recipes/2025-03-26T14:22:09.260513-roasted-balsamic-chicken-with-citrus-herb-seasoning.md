# Roasted Balsamic Chicken with Citrus Herb Seasoning

Ciao amici! Picture this: a golden-roasted chicken, glistening with a tantalizing glaze that's a symphony of sweet, tangy, and herbaceous flavors. This dish is the epitome of my culinary journey, where tradition meets innovation. Let's create magic in your kitchen with our Cranberry Pear White Balsamic, Tuscan Herb Rub, and Citrus Herb Seasoning!

Our Cranberry Pear White Balsamic adds a delicate sweetness and a whisper of fruitiness, perfectly balancing the savory richness of roasted chicken. The Tuscan Herb Rub infuses the dish with aromatic notes of rosemary, thyme, and garlic, while the Citrus Herb Seasoning brightens the flavors with a zesty, refreshing kick.

## Ingredients:

  * 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
  * 2 tablespoons Tuscan Herb Rub
  * 2 tablespoons regular olive oil (or our Tuscan Herb Olive Oil for extra flavor)
  * 2 tablespoons Cranberry Pear White Balsamic
  * 1 teaspoon Citrus Herb Seasoning
  * Salt and pepper to taste


  * Roasting pan
  * Basting brush


  * Regular olive oil can be used instead of Tuscan Herb Olive Oil
  * Regular balsamic vinegar can be used instead of Cranberry Pear White Balsamic



## Instructions:

  1. Preheat the oven to 425째F (220째C).
  2. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels and place them in the roasting pan.
  3. Drizzle the regular olive oil over the chicken thighs and sprinkle them with the Tuscan Herb Rub, making sure to coat them evenly.
  4. Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the skin is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).
  5. In a small bowl, mix the Cranberry Pear White Balsamic and Citrus Herb Seasoning to create the glaze.
  6. During the last 10 minutes of roasting, brush the chicken thighs with the glaze, then return them to the oven to caramelize the glaze.
  7. Once done, remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.



## Chef's Notes:

For a delightful variation, swap the chicken thighs with bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts for a lighter option. You can also increase the amount of Citrus Herb Seasoning for an extra pop of citrus flavor. Remember, the key is to embrace the harmony of flavors!

## Serving Suggestions:

Pair this succulent roasted chicken with a side of fluffy couscous or a vibrant mixed green salad. Garnish with fresh herbs and a drizzle of Cranberry Pear White Balsamic for a final touch of elegance.
