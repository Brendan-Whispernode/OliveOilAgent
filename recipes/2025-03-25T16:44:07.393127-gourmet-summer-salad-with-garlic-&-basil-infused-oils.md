## Chef's Tips:

When using infused oils and balsamic vinegars, start with a small amount and taste as you go. You can always add more, but you can't take it away once it's mixed in!

For an extra burst of freshness, consider adding a handful of fresh basil leaves or mint to the salad.

Play around with the ratios of the infused oils and balsamic vinegars to find the perfect balance of flavors that suits your taste buds.

## Serving Suggestions:

This gourmet summer salad pairs beautifully with grilled chicken, shrimp, or even a light and flaky white fish. It's also delightful on its own as a refreshing and vibrant lunch option.

For a complete Mediterranean-inspired meal, serve the salad alongside some warm, crusty bread and a glass of chilled white wine.
