# Truffle Walnut Mushroom Risotto

Ciao amici! As the autumn breeze starts to dance through the vineyards, I find myself craving a cozy dish that sings with earthy flavors. That's where my Truffle Walnut Mushroom Risotto comes into play. This dish wraps you in a warm embrace of creamy rice, earthy mushrooms, and the subtle kiss of truffle and roasted walnut. It's a melody of flavors that's perfect for a family dinner or a romantic evening in.

Today, we're letting our White Truffle Oil and Roasted Walnut Oil work their magic. Just a drizzle of truffle oil adds a luxurious earthiness, while the roasted walnut oil infuses the risotto with a deep nuttiness and a hint of sweetness. These specialty oils take this classic Italian dish to a whole new level of indulgence.

## Ingredients:

  * 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
  * 6 cups chicken or vegetable broth
  * 1/2 cup finely chopped shallots
  * 2 cloves garlic, minced
  * 1/2 cup dry white wine
  * 8 oz mixed mushrooms (such as cremini and shiitake), sliced
  * 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
  * 1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  * 1 tablespoon White Truffle Oil
  * 2 teaspoons Roasted Walnut Oil
  * Salt and black pepper to taste
  * Fresh parsley for garnish


  * Large skillet or sauté pan
  * Wooden spoon or spatula
  * Medium saucepan


  * Regular olive oil can be used instead of White Truffle Oil
  * Regular olive oil can be used instead of Roasted Walnut Oil



## Instructions:

  1. In a medium saucepan, heat the chicken or vegetable broth over low heat.
  2. In a large skillet or sauté pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic, and sauté until fragrant.
  3. Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and stir to coat the grains with butter, cooking for about 2 minutes until the rice becomes translucent around the edges.
  4. Pour in the white wine and cook, stirring constantly, until the wine is fully absorbed.
  5. Begin adding the warm broth to the rice, one ladleful at a time, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding more. Stir frequently.
  6. Meanwhile, in another skillet, melt the remaining butter over medium-high heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and sauté until they are golden and any liquid has evaporated.
  7. Once the rice is creamy and al dente, remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the sautéed mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
  8. Drizzle the White Truffle Oil and Roasted Walnut Oil over the risotto, and gently fold to incorporate the oils.
  9. Serve the risotto in warm bowls, garnished with fresh parsley.



Chef's Notes: For an extra layer of richness, you can add a splash of heavy cream just before serving. If you're feeling adventurous, try substituting some of the chicken broth with mushroom broth for an even deeper umami flavor.

Serving Suggestions: Pair this Truffle Walnut Mushroom Risotto with a crisp, chilled glass of Pinot Grigio or a light-bodied Chianti. You can also serve it alongside a simple green salad dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette.
