# Roasted Rosemary Chicken with Balsamic Glaze

Ciao amici! Here's a recipe that holds a special place in my heart. Growing up in Tuscany, Sunday dinners were a time for family and feasting. The aroma of rosemary-infused chicken roasting in the oven never failed to bring everyone to the table. Today, I'm sharing a modern twist on this classic dish, enhanced with a touch of our Traditional Dark Balsamic.

Our Traditional Dark Balsamic adds a rich, slightly sweet complexity to this dish. When reduced, it transforms into a luxurious glaze, beautifully complementing the savory flavors of rosemary and chicken. Just a drizzle is all you need to elevate this rustic dish to a gourmet experience.

## Ingredients:

  * 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
  * 2 tablespoons olive oil (regular or Tuscan Herb Olive Oil)
  * 2 cloves garlic, minced
  * 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
  * Salt and black pepper to taste
  * 1/4 cup Traditional Dark Balsamic
  * 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup


  * Roasting pan
  * Basting brush


  * Regular olive oil can be used instead of Tuscan Herb Olive Oil



## Instructions:

  1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
  2. Place the chicken thighs in a roasting pan. Drizzle with olive oil, then season with minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Strip the leaves from one sprig of rosemary and sprinkle over the chicken.
  3. Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the skin is golden and crispy.
  4. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the Traditional Dark Balsamic and honey (or maple syrup) over medium heat. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the glaze thickens slightly.
  5. When the chicken is ready, remove it from the oven and brush the balsamic glaze over each piece using a basting brush. Place the remaining sprig of rosemary on top for a beautiful presentation.
  6. Return the chicken to the oven and roast for an additional 5 minutes to set the glaze.
  7. Serve the roasted rosemary chicken with your favorite sides and enjoy!



Chef's Notes: For a vegetarian option, try this glaze on roasted vegetables or grilled portobello mushrooms. You can also experiment with our Pineapple White Balsamic for a tropical twist!

Serving Suggestion: Pair this succulent chicken with a simple arugula salad dressed with a light vinaigrette made with our Pineapple White Balsamic. The bright acidity will perfectly balance the richness of the dish.
