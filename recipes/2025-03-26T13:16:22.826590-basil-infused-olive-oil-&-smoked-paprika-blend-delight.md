# Basil-Infused Olive Oil & Smoked Paprika Blend Delight

Indulge in this gourmet delight that combines the aromatic essence of basil-infused olive oil with the smoky allure of a special smoked paprika blend. This recipe elevates everyday ingredients to a whole new level, offering a burst of flavors that will tantalize your taste buds.

## Ingredients:

  * 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
  * 2 tablespoons basil-infused olive oil
  * 1 teaspoon smoked paprika blend
  * Salt and pepper to taste



## Instructions:

  1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
  2. Place the chicken breasts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
  3. Drizzle the basil-infused olive oil over the chicken breasts, ensuring they are evenly coated.
  4. Sprinkle the smoked paprika blend, salt, and pepper over the chicken breasts, rubbing the seasonings gently to cover both sides.
  5. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and golden on the outside.
  6. Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving.



### Chef's Tips:

For an extra burst of flavor, drizzle a little more basil-infused olive oil over the chicken just before serving. It will enhance the dish with its fresh, herbal notes.

If you're grilling the chicken instead of baking, brush the basil-infused olive oil on the chicken while grilling to create a tantalizing aroma.

### Serving Suggestions:

Pair this delectable chicken dish with a fresh salad drizzled with a simple vinaigrette made with basil-infused olive oil and a splash of balsamic vinegar for a complete gourmet experience.
