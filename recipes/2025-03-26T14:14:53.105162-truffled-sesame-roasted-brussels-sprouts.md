# Truffled Sesame Roasted Brussels Sprouts

Ciao, amici! As the crisp autumn air settles in, I find myself drawn to the comforting aroma of roasting vegetables. There's something magical about the transformation of humble ingredients into a symphony of flavors. Today, I'm sharing a recipe that celebrates the earthy nuttiness of toasted sesame and the luxurious aroma of white truffle in a simple yet extraordinary dish: Truffled Sesame Roasted Brussels Sprouts.

Our Toasted Sesame Oil adds a delightful depth of nuttiness to the Brussels sprouts, while the White Truffle Oil lends a whisper of decadence, elevating the dish to a whole new level of sophistication. These specialty oils complement the natural sweetness of the sprouts, creating a harmonious blend of flavors that will transport your taste buds to a culinary paradise.

## Ingredients:

  * 1 lb Brussels sprouts, halved
  * 2 tbsp Toasted Sesame Oil
  * 1 tsp White Truffle Oil
  * 1/2 tsp sea salt
  * 1/4 tsp black pepper


  * Baking sheet
  * Parchment paper


  * Regular olive oil for Toasted Sesame Oil
  * Regular balsamic vinegar for White Truffle Oil



## Instructions:

  1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
  2. In a large bowl, toss the Brussels sprouts with Toasted Sesame Oil, White Truffle Oil, sea salt, and black pepper until evenly coated.
  3. Spread the Brussels sprouts in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
  4. Roast for 25-30 minutes, or until the sprouts are golden and tender, tossing halfway through for even browning.
  5. Transfer the roasted Brussels sprouts to a serving dish and drizzle with an extra touch of White Truffle Oil for a final luxurious touch.



## Chef's Notes:

For a delightful variation, sprinkle the roasted Brussels sprouts with a handful of toasted sesame seeds before serving to add a delightful crunch.

Serve these Truffled Sesame Roasted Brussels Sprouts as a stunning side dish alongside grilled meats or as a star on your vegetarian feast. The intoxicating aroma will surely captivate your guests.
